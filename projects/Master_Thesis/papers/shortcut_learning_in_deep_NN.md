# shortcut learning in deep neural networks
*i.i.d. data*: independent and identically distributed data. E.g. split dataset1 into training and test datasets, these two are i.i.d..<br>
*o.o.d. data*: out-of-distribution data. E.g. dataset2.<br>

The model learned something we do not intend it to do.

Human cannot formulate an intended feature. E.g. shape.
