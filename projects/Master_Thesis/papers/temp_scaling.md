# On Calibration of Modern Neural Networks
- Confidence calibration (calibrating predictions):  predicting probability estimates representative of the true correctness likelihood.
- depth, width, weight decay, and Batch Normalization are important factors influencing calibration.
- authors find *temperature scaling* – a singleparameter variant of Platt Scaling, is very effective at calibrating predictions.
- 所谓Confidence calibration指的是我们对预测出来的概率有多confident.
