# RAPID LEARNING OR FEATURE REUSE? TOWARDS UNDERSTANDING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF MAML

> CCA provides a way to the compare representations of two (latent) layers L1, L2 of a neural network, outputting a similarity score between 0 (not similar at all) and 1 (identical). 
> the inner loop induces little to no functional change. 
> remove the inner loop updates for the network body, and apply inner loop adaptation only to the head.
