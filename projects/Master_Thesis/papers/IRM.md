# Invariant Risk Minimization
- goal: learn correlations invariant(stable) across training environments.
- i.e. finding a data representation such that the optimal classifier, on top of that data representation, is the same for all environments. 
- IRM: a learning paradigm to estimate data representations eliciting invariant predictors $w \cdot \phi$ across multiple environments. ($\phi$ is the features)
