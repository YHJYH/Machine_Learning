key words: shortcuts detection<br>
extension: <br>
- will generator in GAN also generate (congruent/incongruent) shortcuts?
    - do shallow Generator just do the job (detecing sc)?
    - if SG does, can we do sth like in LCN-HCN, to down-weight the items SG grabs in DG training?
- can we use MTL to find important features? such as bbox in object localization would contain shape features.
    - what feature does segmentation task grab?
